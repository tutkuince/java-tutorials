/*(Game: Eight Queens) The classic Eight Queens puzzle is to place eight queens
on a chess board such that no two queens can attack each other (i.e., no two queens
are on the same row, same column, or same diagonal). There are many possible
solutions. Write a program that displays one such solution.
